## Usage
    Since this is JavaScript-focused, I have hit yet another series of bone-shattering walls. The code is obnoxiously long, and it is broken. It's not a finished product. If I had more time to finish, I could have probably figured it out. There are far too many event-listeners competing at once, and the functions are running out of order. The timer isn't working, and the results page is basically blank. The high scores aspect was barely a thought in my mind. This code needs a deep clean before anything else is added.
