                <p>
                    This quiz is meant to test your knowledge on the basics
                    of coding. The current level is "Novice."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The timer will start at 60 seconds. Since you can always
                    look up the answer on your phone, the scoring will work
                    based on this time limit. Correct answers will add more time,
                    thus adding more points. Wrong answers will subtract time. 
                    Blank answers will do nothing to the time. It is okay to admit you
                    are unaware of an answer, making a blank answer more valuable than 
                    an incorrect answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at this quiz as a refresher, a way to commit basic
                    concepts to memory. This is not an IQ test, nor is it the LSAT.
                    Breathe, tap into your memory, and walk to the other side.
